# numPy.random
An investigation into the numpy.random package

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb), which overviews and goes into some high-level explanation the various components of the numPy.random package.

In order to run and view this notebook locally, you should do the following:
- Download and Install the latest version of Anaconda on your machine
- Download the .ipynb file from this repository, into a local directory
- open the command line prompt specific to your OS (I am using Terminal on Mac OS, you may also use command prompt on Windows)
- enter the command **jupyter notebook**. This will open a Jupyter web-browser interface displaying your machines file structure, with your current working directory as root.
- You will see a list of folders displayed. Navigate to the location of the .ipynb file and click on it. This will open the notebook in a new browser tab.
- You can now interact with the Jupyter notebook.

The notebook contains a mixture of markdown cells and executable code cells.
In order to execute the embedded code, place the cursor inside a cell, then press Shift+Enter.
Please ensure to run each code cell in turn, from start to finish. If you find that any cell is not working correctly, return and re-run the previous related cells and try again.
